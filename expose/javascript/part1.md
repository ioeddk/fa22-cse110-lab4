## Question 4
Code returns an error, which is the `result` undefined. This is because line 13 is out of the block the `result` is defiend in, whcih is the if block. Thus at that place the variable `result` is considered undefined. 
## Question 5
Code returns an error, because `result` is defined as a constant and its value cannot be changed. Thus trying to assign it a new value returns an error. 
## Question 6
The execution doesn't reaches here at all, since it terminates at line 9 which throws an `assignment to constant variable` error.
